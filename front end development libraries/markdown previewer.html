# Hello, World!

Above is an example of Markdown heading.
Level one to be specific.  There are six
levels of heading in HTML and Markdown.

## Here are some more examples

Adding more hashtags increases the heading 
level respectively. So the above heading is
level two.  Headings should proceed linearly;
meaning one precedes a two which procedes a three.
In other words, don't go directly from a level
one heading to level three heading, make sure
there is a level two inbetween!

### Emphasizing Text

Headings should be used to bring structure to
a document. If you need to make text **bold**
surround it with two ampersands. *Italic* text
is surrounded by one ampersand.  You can make
text ***bold and italic*** by using three ampersands.

### Making a List

Tired of reading paragraphs? You can make lists
by starting a line with a dash.

- Dashes get turned into bullet point lists
- Bullet point lists are great for making unordered 
  points
- Unordered points can be read in any order and still
  make sense

Ordered lists should be made with ascending number 
counts followed by a period.  The three rules of 
order lists are:

1. All ordered lists must start at 1, use CSS to change the number
1. Ordered lists can be made up of a 1's or ascending numbers
1. The three rules of order lists are unordered points

## Advanced Examples

Only images and hyperlinks are supported in Markdown. To make
a link use braces around anchor text followed by parenthesis
around url text, like so: [My Emoji Self Portrait](/happy emoji portrait.svg)

Images are similar to hyperlinks, but their braces are preceded
by an exclamation, and their braced text should describe the image.

[Smiling square face](/happy emoji portrait.svg)

Media URLs can be very long, so Markdown has another way
to specify media elements if your raw text needs to look pretty.
If you are into that level of detail though, you should probably
look into the CommonMark Spec for other neat tips and tricks.

### Adding semantics

When quoting someone you can use quotemarks, but an 
unambiguous way to do this in Markdown is to start 
lines with a greater than symbol.

> This is one blockquote.
> You can quote me on that.

Surrounding text in tick marks denotes code examples.
Short examples that fit inline like `Hello, World!` only
need one tick mark.  To specify blocks of code surround
text with three tick marks.

```
/* This is a JavaScript block comment
   It might also be a block comment in other languages
*/
```

Finally, for thematic breaks there is the horizontal rule.
---
Three dashes in a row draws a line (usually) in the rendered
document.  Try not to use horizontal rules for styling though.
Their real purpose is to declare a thematic change, like a
change of scene in a play or a change from setup dialog to
punchline in a joke.
---
Remember, jokes don't land if you don't set them up.
